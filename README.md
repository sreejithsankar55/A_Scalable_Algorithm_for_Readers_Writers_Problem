Open terminal for each command and execute the following:

`$ chmod +x *`

`$ ./run.sh`

`$ java MyServer`

`$ java Writer`

`$ java Reader`  <br />

Now you can use the phrases like "pause", "resume" and "stop" for the reader. <br />

Also in MyServer.java file, make sure the ip address is properly set.
